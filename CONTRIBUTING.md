## Workflow

TBD

## Project layout

The structure of this project was shaped based on the [turbopack's example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/design-system).

`packages` directory contains code mostly generated by the [icommon-tools](https://github.com/graaphscom/icommon-tools), with the following exceptions:

```
+ packages
|-- components // tools to render icons in React
|-- eslint-config
|-- typescript-config
```

## Managing dependencies

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is the package manager in this project.

To add a dependency, run:

```zsh
pnpm --filter <filters> add <pkg>
```

Where `<filters>` is specified according to the [pnpm's docs](https://pnpm.io/filtering).

## Code formatting

The large amount of available icons results in a lot of files and code.
To not waste CPU time, the only checked package is `packages/components`.

It's [icommon-tools'](https://github.com/graaphscom/icommon-tools) responsibility to generate well-formatted code.

## Typescript compilation

[icommon-tools](https://github.com/graaphscom/icommon-tools) generate JS code and TS definitions ready to be published to npm without any changes.
However, the generated code may be incorrect. For example, there may be duplicate icon names. In this case [icommon-tools](https://github.com/graaphscom/icommon-tools) fixes are needed. To detect such scenarios, `tsc` is run in "dry mode" on generated icons packages.

On the other side, `packages/components` is a typical library. Compilation should produce JS files and TS declarations.
